            <p> Karryn holds 12 years experience as an optometrist were she has worked in both private and public sectors in regional and metropolitan settings. She has been the lead optometrist at a high-end boutique practice with annual revenue of $1.5m, gaining a sound understanding of the commercial processes involved in running an optometry practice. Before this, she was the 2IC optometrist at a regional practice specialising in disease management and multidisciplinary care. She has also developed deep technical expertise in treating certain eye conditions as a result of implementing new and emerging treatment at her place of work, allowed her to establish a growing patient database and become the ‘expert’ optometrist at her practice. Karryn is a strong advocate for her profession, having served for 6 years on the committee of the Contact Lens Society of Australia. She has gained insights into stake holder management, product management and customer experience through her various clinical roles.

            <p> She is passionate about healthcare and how new technologies can be used to improve access to quality healthcare, and to cultivate innovation in the industry to achieve this. Working on the frontline as a primary healthcare provider she has come across many outdated and inefficient processes in the healthcare space, costing valuable time and money for both practitioners and patients. She is hungry to modernise healthcare by using emerging technology to improve outcomes for both patients and practitioners by improving efficiency and accuracy.</p>
            <br>    
            <p>She sees software development as the best pathway for someone with a niche skill set to integrate technology and healthcare. Being a super learner and diverse thinker she is constantly acquiring and adapting new skills to improve with every iteration. These skills are easily transferable and adaptable to software engineering where she can make a positive difference in healthtech.</p>
